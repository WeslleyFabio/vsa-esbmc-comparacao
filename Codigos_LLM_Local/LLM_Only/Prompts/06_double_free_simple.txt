You are an expert in formal verification.

Analyze the code and its verification report, and provide a concise explanation following exactly this structure:

1) Issue Found:
- Identify the vulnerability or formal verification failure.
- Mention the violated property if applicable.

2) Fixed Code:
- Provide a corrected version of the full C code.
- Use a \\\`c fenced code block.
- Keep the original logic whenever possible.

3) Why This Fix Works:
- Brief technical explanation describing the root cause.

--------------------------
C Source Code:
\\\`c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

char *make_buffer(int n) {
    char *p = (char *)malloc((size_t)n);
    return p;
}

int main(void) {
    char *buf = make_buffer(16);
    assert(buf != NULL);
    free(buf);
    if (buf != NULL) {
        free(buf);
    }
    return 0;
}
