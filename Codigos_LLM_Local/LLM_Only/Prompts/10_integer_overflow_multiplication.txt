You are an expert in formal verification.

Analyze the code and its verification report, and provide a concise explanation following exactly this structure:

1) Issue Found:
- Identify the vulnerability or formal verification failure.
- Mention the violated property if applicable.

2) Fixed Code:
- Provide a corrected version of the full C code.
- Use a \\\`c fenced code block.
- Keep the original logic whenever possible.

3) Why This Fix Works:
- Brief technical explanation describing the root cause.

--------------------------
C Source Code:
\\\`c
#include <assert.h>
#include <limits.h>

int multiply(int a, int b) {
    int c = a * b;
    return c;
}

int main(void) {
    int a = INT_MAX;
    int b = 2;
    int c = multiply(a, b);
    assert(c >= a);
    return 0;
}
