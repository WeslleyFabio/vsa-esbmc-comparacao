You are an expert in formal verification.

Analyze the code and its verification report, and provide a concise explanation following exactly this structure:

1) Issue Found:
- Identify the vulnerability or formal verification failure.
- Mention the violated property if applicable.

2) Fixed Code:
- Provide a corrected version of the full C code.
- Use a \\\`c fenced code block.
- Keep the original logic whenever possible.

3) Why This Fix Works:
- Brief technical explanation describing the root cause.

--------------------------
C Source Code:
\\\`c
#include <assert.h>

int count_positive(const int *a, int n) {
    int c = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (a[i] > 0) {
            ++c;
        }
    }
    return c;
}

int main(void) {
    int v[3] = {1, -1, 2};
    int c = count_positive(v, 3);
    assert(c == 2);
    return 0;
}
