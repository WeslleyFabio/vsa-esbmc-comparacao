You are an expert in formal verification.

Analyze the code and its verification report, and provide a concise explanation following exactly this structure:

1) Issue Found:
- Identify the vulnerability or formal verification failure.
- Mention the violated property if applicable.

2) Fixed Code:
- Provide a corrected version of the full C code.
- Use a \\\`c fenced code block.
- Keep the original logic whenever possible.

3) Why This Fix Works:
- Brief technical explanation describing the root cause.

--------------------------
C Source Code:
\\\`c
#include <assert.h>
#include <string.h>

struct Buffer {
    char data[8];
    int flag;
};

void fill_buffer(struct Buffer *b, const char *src) {
    memcpy(b->data, src, sizeof(*b));
}

int main(void) {
    struct Buffer b;
    b.flag = 1;
    fill_buffer(&b, "ABCDEFGH");
    assert(b.flag == 1);
    return 0;
}
