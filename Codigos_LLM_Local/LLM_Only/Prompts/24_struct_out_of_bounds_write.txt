You are an expert in formal verification.

Analyze the code and its verification report, and provide a concise explanation following exactly this structure:

1) Issue Found:
- Identify the vulnerability or formal verification failure.
- Mention the violated property if applicable.

2) Fixed Code:
- Provide a corrected version of the full C code.
- Use a \\\`c fenced code block.
- Keep the original logic whenever possible.

3) Why This Fix Works:
- Brief technical explanation describing the root cause.

--------------------------
C Source Code:
\\\`c
#include <assert.h>

struct Pair {
    int values[2];
};

void write_third(struct Pair *p) {
    p->values[2] = 10;
}

int main(void) {
    struct Pair p;
    p.values[0] = 1;
    p.values[1] = 2;
    write_third(&p);
    assert(p.values[1] == 2);
    return 0;
}
