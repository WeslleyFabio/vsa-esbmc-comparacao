**Verification Report Analysis**

The verification report indicates a potential memory corruption issue in the code.

**1) Issue Found:**
- **Vulnerability:** The `realloc` function is not checked for successful reallocation, which can lead to memory corruption.
- **Violated Property:** The property "Memory management operations are properly handled" is violated.

**2) Fixed Code:**
\\\`
\\\`c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    int *p = (int *)malloc(2 * sizeof(int));
    if (!p) {
        return 1;
    }
    p[0] = 1;
    p[1] = 2;
    int *q = realloc(p, 4 * sizeof(int));
    if (q == NULL || q != p) { // Check for successful reallocation
        free(p);
        return 1;
    }
    q[2] = 3;
    q[3] = 4;
    assert(q[3] == 4);
    free(q);
    return 0;
}
\\\`

**3) Why This Fix Works:**
The root cause of the issue is that `realloc` can fail to reallocate memory, in which case it returns `NULL`. If `realloc` succeeds, it may also return a pointer to the same memory block as before. Therefore, we need to check both conditions:
- `q == NULL`: if `realloc` failed.
- `q != p`: if `realloc` succeeded and returned a new pointer. This ensures that the original memory block is freed safely.

By checking these two conditions, we ensure proper handling of memory management operations, preventing potential memory corruption issues.
