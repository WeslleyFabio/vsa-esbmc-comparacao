**Formal Verification Analysis**

1. **Issue Found:**
The code has a bug in the `index_of_min` function, which attempts to access an out-of-bounds element of array `a`. This is due to the condition in the for loop `i <= n`, causing `a[i]` to be accessed with an index that may exceed the bounds of the array when `n` is equal to the size of the array.

   **Violated Property:** The function does not guarantee that it will return a valid index within the bounds of the input array, violating the property of returning a valid index for all possible inputs.

2. **Fixed Code:**
\\\`c
#include <assert.h>

int index_of_min(const int *a, int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        // Handle invalid inputs to prevent out-of-bounds access
        return -1; // or any other sentinel value indicating error
    }
    
    int idx = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) { // Change in loop condition: i < n instead of i <= n
        if (a[i] < a[idx]) {
            idx = i;
        }
    }
    return idx;
}

int main(void) {
    int v[3] = {5, 2, 9};
    int idx = index_of_min(v, 3);
    assert(idx == 1);
    return 0;
}
\\\`

3. **Why This Fix Works:**
The fix involves changing the loop condition in the `index_of_min` function to `i < n`, which ensures that we do not access an element of array `a` beyond its bounds when `n` is equal to the size of the array. This change prevents the out-of-bounds access bug by limiting the for loop to iterate only up to but not including the index that would cause this problem. The code also adds a check at the beginning of the function to handle invalid inputs, returning an error value (such as -1) in case `n` is less than or equal to zero, preventing potential crashes due to accessing memory outside allocated space.
