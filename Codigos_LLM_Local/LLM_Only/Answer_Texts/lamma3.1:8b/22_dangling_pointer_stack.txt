Here's the analysis:

**1) Issue Found:**
- **Dangling Pointer Vulnerability:** The `store_address` function returns a pointer to a local variable `x`, which goes out of scope once the function returns. This leaves the returned pointer pointing to invalid memory, causing undefined behavior when accessed.
- **Violated Property (SPASS):** "No dangling pointers"

**2) Fixed Code:**
\\\`c
#include <assert.h>

int x = 5; // move declaration to file scope

int *store_address(void) {
    return &x;
}

int main(void) {
    int *q = store_address();
    int v = *q;
    assert(v == 5);
    return 0;
}
\\\`

**3) Why This Fix Works:**
By moving the declaration of `x` to file scope, we ensure that it remains in memory throughout the execution of the program. The `store_address` function now returns a pointer to a valid global variable, avoiding the dangling pointer issue.
