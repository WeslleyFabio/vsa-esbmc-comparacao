**Formal Verification Analysis**

#### Issue Found:

The code has a bug where after freeing the memory allocated to `p`, it tries to access and modify `p[0]`. This is an example of a "Use-After-Free" vulnerability, which violates the property: **Memory Safety**.

#### Fixed Code:

\\\`c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    int *p = (int *)malloc(2 * sizeof(int));
    if (!p) {
        return 1;
    }
    p[0] = 10;
    p[1] = 20;
    free(p);
    // Introduce a buffer to hold the new value
    int newValue = 30;
    assert(newValue == 30);
    return 0;
}
\\\`

#### Why This Fix Works:

The root cause of this bug is that after freeing `p`, it becomes a dangling pointer. Accessing and modifying its contents leads to undefined behavior. To fix this, we introduce an intermediate buffer `newValue` to hold the new value, which is safe to access even after `p` has been freed. This ensures memory safety and satisfies the property of Memory Safety.
