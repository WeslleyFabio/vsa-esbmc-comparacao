**Formal Verification Report Analysis**

The formal verification report highlights the following issue:

1. **Issue Found:**
- The property "always a <= b => max(a,b) = b" is violated.
This means that there exists an input where the maximum of two values is not correctly computed, violating the expected behavior.

2. **Fixed Code:**
\\\`c
#include <assert.h>

int max_of_two(int a, int b) {
    if (a > b) { // Corrected condition to ensure return value is correct
        return a;
    }
    return b;
}

int main(void) {
    int m = max_of_two(3, 5);
    assert(m == 5);
    return 0;
}
\\\`

3. **Why This Fix Works:**
The root cause of the issue was that the condition in the `if` statement was checking if `a` is less than `b`, which led to incorrect maximum value selection when `a` is indeed greater than `b`. By changing the condition to `a > b`, we ensure that `a` is correctly chosen as the maximum value when it's greater than `b`, thus satisfying the expected property.
