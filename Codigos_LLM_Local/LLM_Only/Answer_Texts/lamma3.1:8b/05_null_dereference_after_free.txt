Here's the analysis:

**1) Issue Found:**

* The vulnerability is a potential null pointer dereference.
* The violated property is that the `sum_array` function should not access memory outside the allocated region when passed an invalid array size.

The issue arises from the fact that the `main` function passes `data` to `sum_array`, which has been freed after use. This causes the `sum_array` function to access deallocated memory, leading to undefined behavior.

**2) Fixed Code:**

\\\`c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int sum_array(int *a, int n) {
    if (n <= 0 || !a) {
        return -1; // or any other error code
    }
    int s = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n && a[i] != 0; ++i) {
        s += a[i];
    }
    return s;
}

int main(void) {
    int *data = (int *)malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
    if (!data) {
        return 1;
    }
    data[0] = 1;
    data[1] = 2;
    data[2] = 3;
    free(data);
    data = NULL; // Set the pointer to NULL after freeing
    int result = sum_array(data, 3); // Should now return -1 (or error code)
    assert(result == -1); // or assert with expected value
    return 0;
}
\\\`

**3) Why This Fix Works:**

The fix works by setting the `data` pointer to `NULL` after freeing it. This ensures that when `sum_array` is called, it will not attempt to access deallocated memory. Additionally, I've added a check in `sum_array` to ensure that the array size `n` is valid and non-negative. If an invalid size is passed, the function returns an error code (`-1` here). This prevents the function from accessing memory outside the allocated region when passed an incorrect array size.
