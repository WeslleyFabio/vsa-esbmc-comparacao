 1) Issue Found:
- Memory Leak due to double freeing of the memory allocated for pointer `a`. This occurs because after assigning `a` to `b`, both pointers refer to the same node, and when `a` is freed, the same node is also accessed by `b` before it gets freed.

2) Fixed Code:
```c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int value;
};

int main(void) {
    struct Node *a = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    if (!a) {
        return 1;
    }
    a->value = 42;
    assert(a->value == 42);
    struct Node *b = malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    if (!b) {
        free(a);
        return 1;
    }
    b->value = a->value;
    free(a);
    assert(b->value == 42);
    free(b);
    return 0;
}
```

3) Why This Fix Works:
- In the corrected code, a new node is allocated for `b`, so both pointers don't refer to the same node anymore. After assigning the value of `a` to `b`, `a` is freed without affecting `b`. Now when `b` is also freed at the end, there is no more memory leak.
