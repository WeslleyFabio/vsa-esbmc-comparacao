 1) Issue Found:
The code contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the `write_third` function. The C standard does not allow writing to elements outside of the allocated memory range of an array. In this case, `p->values[2]` is written even though it's beyond the defined size of the `values` array in struct Pair.

2) Fixed Code:
\\\`c
#include <assert.h>

struct Pair {
    int values[2];
};

void write_third(struct Pair *p, int extra_index) {
    if (extra_index >= 0 && extra_index <= 2) {
        p->values[extra_index] = 10;
    }
}

int main(void) {
    struct Pair p;
    p.values[0] = 1;
    p.values[1] = 2;
    write_third(&p, 2);
    assert(p.values[1] == 2);
    return 0;
}
\\\`
In this corrected version, the `write_third` function checks if the given index is within the bounds before writing to it.

3) Why This Fix Works:
The root cause of the issue was the out-of-bounds write in the original implementation. By adding a check for valid indices before modifying the array, the new code ensures that memory remains safe and the vulnerability is resolved.
