 1) Issue Found:
The code has a memory leak due to freeing the incorrect pointer. In this case, the pointer `p` is freed before the newly allocated memory with `q`. The variable `p` still holds valid data that should not be deallocated before `q`. This results in a memory leak.

2) Fixed Code:
```c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    int *p = (int *)malloc(2 * sizeof(int));
    if (!p) {
        return 1;
    }
    p[0] = 1;
    p[1] = 2;
    int *q = (int *)realloc(p, 4 * sizeof(int));
    if (q == NULL) {
        free(p);
        return 1;
    }
    p = q;   // Assign the new pointer to 'p' to avoid memory leak.
    p[2] = 3;
    p[3] = 4;
    assert(p[3] == 4);
    free(p);
    return 0;
}
```

3) Why This Fix Works:
By assigning the new pointer obtained from `realloc(p, 4 * sizeof(int))` to the original pointer `p`, we prevent memory leakage by ensuring that the new memory block is managed instead of the old one. The old memory block allocated for 2 integers is now deallocated correctly when `free(p)` is called later in the code.
