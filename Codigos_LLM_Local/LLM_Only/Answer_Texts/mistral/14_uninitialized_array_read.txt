 1) Issue Found:
The code has an uninitialized array `a[3]`. This leads to undefined behavior, as the values of the array elements are not guaranteed to be set before they are used. In this case, it causes the assertion in `main()` to fail because `v` is not equal to 0. The violated property here is that the function `sum_first_three()` should return the sum of the first three integers initialized with some values, but due to uninitialized array, it does not satisfy this property.

2) Fixed Code:
To fix the issue, we need to initialize the array before summing its elements. Here's a corrected version of the code:

```c
#include <assert.h>

int sum_first_three(void) {
    int a[3] = {0, 0, 0}; // Initialize the array with zeros
    int s = a[0] + a[1] + a[2];
    return s;
}

int main(void) {
    int v = sum_first_three();
    assert(v == 0); // Now the sum of all elements is zero, so the assertion will pass
    return 0;
}
```

3) Why This Fix Works:
The fix works by initializing the array with zeros before using its elements to calculate the sum. This ensures that the values in the array are well-defined and satisfy the required property, i.e., the function `sum_first_three()` returns the sum of the first three integers initialized with zero values.
