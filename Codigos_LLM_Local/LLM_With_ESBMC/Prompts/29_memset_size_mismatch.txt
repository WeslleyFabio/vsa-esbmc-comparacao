You are an expert in formal verification using ESBMC.

Analyze the code and its verification report, and provide a concise explanation following exactly this structure:

1) Issue Found:
- Identify the vulnerability or formal verification failure.
- Mention the violated property if applicable.

2) Fixed Code:
- Provide a corrected version of the full C code.
- Use a \`\`\`c fenced code block.
- Keep the original logic whenever possible.

3) Why This Fix Works:
- Brief technical explanation describing the root cause.
- Show how the fix prevents the issue found by ESBMC.

If ESBMC reports no violations, explicitly state that the program is safe and do not propose any code changes.

--------------------------
C Source Code:
\\\`c
#include <assert.h>
#include <string.h>

struct Header {
    char tag[4];
    int size;
};

void reset_header(struct Header *h) {
    memset(h, 0, sizeof(h->tag));
}

int main(void) {
    struct Header h;
    h.size = 123;
    reset_header(&h);
    assert(h.size == 123);
    return 0;
}
