Here's the analysis of the code and ESBMC report:

1) Issue Found:
- **Vulnerability:** Buffer overflow due to incorrect size calculation when allocating memory for `buf`.
- **Violated property:** Array bounds violation.

2) Fixed Code:
```c
#include <assert.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

char *duplicate_prefix(const char *src, size_t n) {
    size_t src_len = strlen(src);
    if (n > src_len) {
        n = src_len;
    }
    char *buf = (char *)malloc(n + 1); // allocate space for the null terminator
    if (!buf) {
        return NULL;
    }
    memcpy(buf, src, n + 1);
    return buf;
}

int main(void) {
    const char *s = "hello world";
    char *p = duplicate_prefix(s, 5);
    assert(p != NULL);
    free(p);
    return 0;
}
```

3) Why This Fix Works:
- The original code allocated memory for `buf` with size `n`, which is the number of characters to copy from `src`. However, this does not take into account the null terminator that will be added at the end of the copied string.
- By changing the allocation size to `n + 1`, we ensure that there is enough space for the null terminator, preventing a buffer overflow when `memcpy` copies the string.
- The fix also includes a check to prevent allocating more memory than necessary by taking into account the actual length of the input string `src`.
