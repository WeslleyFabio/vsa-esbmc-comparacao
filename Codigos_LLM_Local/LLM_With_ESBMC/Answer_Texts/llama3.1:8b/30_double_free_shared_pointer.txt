**1) Issue Found:**
- The vulnerability found is a double-free error, which occurs when the same memory block is deallocated (freed) twice.
- The violated property is "dereference failure: invalidated dynamic object freed".

**2) Fixed Code:**
```c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int value;
};

int main(void) {
    struct Node *a = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    if (!a) {
        return 1;
    }
    a->value = 42;
    struct Node *b = a; // copy the pointer, do not assign the same pointer
    assert(b->value == 42);
    free(a); // free 'a' first
    b = NULL; // set 'b' to NULL after freeing 'a'
    free(b); // now it's safe to free 'b'
    return 0;
}
```

**3) Why This Fix Works:**
- The root cause of the issue is that we're trying to free the same memory block twice, which leads to undefined behavior.
- By introducing a copy of the pointer `a` to `b`, we ensure that both pointers point to the same location in memory. After freeing `a`, it's safe to free `b` as well.
- This fix prevents the double-free error by making sure that each pointer points to different locations in memory, and thus avoids deallocating the same memory block twice.
