) Issue Found:
- The vulnerability found is a divide-by-zero error.
- The violated property is "division by zero" (b != 0).

2) Fixed Code:
```c
#include <assert.h>

int safe_divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        // Return an error or handle the case as desired
        return -1; // Or some other sentinel value to indicate failure
    }
    return a / b;
}

int main(void) {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 0;
    int z = safe_divide(x, y);
    assert(z == -1); // Or whatever the expected error value is
    return 0;
}
```

3) Why This Fix Works:
- The root cause of the issue was that the `safe_divide` function did not check if the divisor (`b`) is zero before performing the division.
- By adding a simple `if` statement to check for this condition, we ensure that the function returns an error value or handles the case as desired when a divide-by-zero occurs.
- This fix prevents the issue by ensuring that the program does not attempt to perform division by zero, thus avoiding undefined behavior and preventing crashes.
