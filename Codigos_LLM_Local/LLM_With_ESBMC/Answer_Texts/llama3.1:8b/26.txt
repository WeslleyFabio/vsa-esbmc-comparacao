Here is the analysis following the specified structure:

**1) Issue Found:**
- The issue found by ESBMC is an out-of-bounds access to the array `a` in the function `count_positive`.
- The property violated is related to dereference failure due to array bounds violation.

**2) Fixed Code:**
```c
#include <assert.h>

int count_positive(const int *a, int n) {
    int c = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { // corrected loop condition
        if (a[i] > 0) {
            ++c;
        }
    }
    return c;
}

int main(void) {
    int v[3] = {1, -1, 2};
    int c = count_positive(v, 3);
    assert(c == 2);
    return 0;
}
```

**3) Why This Fix Works:**
- The root cause of the issue is that the loop iterates one extra time when `i` reaches the value of `n`, leading to an out-of-bounds access.
- The fix simply changes the loop condition from `i <= n` to `i < n`. This ensures that the loop only iterates up to but not including `n`, preventing the array bounds violation.
