*1) Issue Found:**
- The vulnerability found is a memory leak due to the lack of deallocation of dynamically allocated memory.
- The property violated is "data != NULL" in the main function.

**2) Fixed Code:**
```c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int *allocate_and_fill(int n, int value) {
    int *p = (int *)malloc((size_t)n * sizeof(int));
    if (!p) {
        return NULL;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        p[i] = value;
    }
    return p;
}

int main(void) {
    int *data = allocate_and_fill(4, 7);
    assert(data != NULL);
    if (data != NULL) { // check for non-null before accessing
        int ok = data[0] == 7;
        assert(ok);
        free(data); // deallocate memory to prevent leak
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**3) Why This Fix Works:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is that dynamically allocated memory is not being properly deallocated.
- By adding a `free` call after accessing the memory, we ensure that it is released back to the system, preventing a memory leak.
