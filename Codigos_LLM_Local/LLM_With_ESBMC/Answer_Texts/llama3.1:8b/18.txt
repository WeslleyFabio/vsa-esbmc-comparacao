*1) Issue Found:**
- The vulnerability found is a potential assertion failure, where `v` can be `-5` instead of `5`.
- The violated property is the assertion `v == 5` at line 12 column 5 in function `main`.

**2) Fixed Code:**
```c
#include <assert.h>

int absolute_value(int x) {
    if (x >= 0) {
        return x;
    }
    return -x;
}

int main(void) {
    int v = absolute_value(-5);
    assert(v == 5);
    return 0;
}
```

**3) Why This Fix Works:**
The original code had a logic error in the `absolute_value` function, where it returned `x` when `x < 0`. This led to the assertion failure. The fix is to change the condition in the `if` statement to `x >= 0`, and return `-x` when `x < 0`. This ensures that the absolute value of any integer is always non-negative, and the assertion will pass.

Note that this fix only changes the logic inside the `absolute_value` function.
