Here is the analysis following the specified structure:

**1) Issue Found:**
- The vulnerability or formal verification failure is an out-of-bounds access to the array `a` in the function `count_positive`.
- The violated property is that of dereference failure due to array bounds being violated.

**2) Fixed Code:**
```c
int count_positive(const int *a, int n) {
    int c = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { // Change <= to <
        if (a[i] > 0) {
            ++c;
        }
    }
    return c;
}
```

**3) Why This Fix Works:**
The root cause of the issue is that the loop condition in the `count_positive` function was not correctly checking the bounds of the array `a`. The original code had a condition of `i <= n`, which would allow the index `i` to go out of bounds when accessing `a[i]`.

By changing the loop condition to `i < n`, we ensure that the index `i` never exceeds the maximum valid index for the array, thus preventing any out-of-bounds access. This fix prevents the issue found by ESBMC and ensures that the program is safe from array bounds violations.
