**1) Issue Found:**

* The vulnerability is an **out-of-bounds array access**, which violates the property that arrays should not be accessed with indices greater than or equal to their size.
* Specifically, the bug occurs when `i` reaches `n` in the loop, causing `arr[i]` to be accessed outside of its bounds.

**2) Fixed Code:**

```c
int last_element(int *arr, int n) {
    int last = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { // Changed from <= to <
        last = arr[i];
    }
    return last;
}
```

**3) Why This Fix Works:**

The fix prevents the out-of-bounds access by changing the loop condition from `i <= n` to `i < n`. This ensures that `arr[i]` is never accessed when `i` equals `n`, thus preventing the array bounds violation.

By making this change, we prevent the counterexample reported by ESBMC, and the program is now safe.
