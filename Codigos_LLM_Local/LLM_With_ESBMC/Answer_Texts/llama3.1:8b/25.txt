*1) Issue Found:**
- The vulnerability found is a buffer overflow due to an out-of-bounds read on the `a` array in the `sum_array` function.
- The property that is violated is related to dereference failure, specifically array bounds violation.

**2) Fixed Code:**
```c
#include <assert.h>

int sum_array(const int *a, int n) {
    int s = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        s += a[i];
    }
    return s;
}

int main(void) {
    int v[3] = {1, 2, 3};
    int s = sum_array(v, 3);
    assert(s == 6);
    return 0;
}
```

**3) Why This Fix Works:**
The fix was to change the loop condition in the `sum_array` function from `i <= n` to `i < n`. This prevents the array index `a[i]` from going out of bounds when accessing `a[n]`, which is undefined behavior. By changing the condition, we ensure that only valid indices are used for array access.

Note: The original code had a common mistake where the loop iterated one extra time beyond the array's bounds. ESBMC successfully detected this error and provided a counterexample to demonstrate the violation.
