 1) Issue Found:
The code contains an integer overflow vulnerability. The variables 'a' and 'b' are initialized with `INT_MAX` and 10 respectively, and the function `add_ints(int a, int b)` adds these two integers together, resulting in a sum greater than `INT_MAX`. This exceeds the maximum representable value for an integer, causing overflow. The violated property is the assertion `c > a`, which fails because `c` (the sum of `a` and `b`) overflows and wraps around to a smaller value than `a`.

2) Fixed Code:
```c
#include <assert.h>
#include <limits.h>

int add_ints(int a, int b) {
    if (a > INT_MAX - b) return -1; // Check for overflow before adding
    int c = a + b;
    return c;
}

int main(void) {
    int a = INT_MAX;
    int b = 10;
    int c = add_ints(a, b);
    if (c == -1) // Check for overflow condition
        printf("Integer overflow detected.\n");
    else {
        assert(c > a);
        printf("The sum is: %d\n", c);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
3) Why This Fix Works:
This fix adds an additional check before adding the two integers to ensure that the result will not overflow. If the sum would exceed `INT_MAX`, the function returns `-1` instead, indicating an integer overflow condition. By incorporating this check, the issue found by ESBMC is prevented, and the code becomes safe from integer overflow vulnerabilities when adding two large integers.
