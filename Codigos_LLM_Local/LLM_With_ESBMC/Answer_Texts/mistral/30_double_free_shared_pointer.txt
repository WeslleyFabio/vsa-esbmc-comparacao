 1) Issue Found:
The program violates the memory safety property, specifically double free of a shared pointer `b`. In this case, after freeing `a`, the program still uses `b`, which points to the same dynamically allocated memory. This issue leads to undefined behavior and potential program crash. The violated property is "dereference failure: invalidated dynamic object freed".

2) Fixed Code:
```c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int value;
};

int main(void) {
    struct Node *a = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    struct Node *b = a;
    if (!a) {
        return 1;
    }
    a->value = 42;
    assert(b->value == 42);
    b = NULL; // Freeing the memory by setting it to NULL before free(b)
    free(a);
    free(b);
    return 0;
}
```

3) Why This Fix Works:
The fix works by setting `b` to NULL before freeing it. This way, after `free(a)`, the memory associated with `b` is no longer accessible or usable. By making `b` point to NULL instead of being a null pointer (which would still cause double free), the program avoids the violation of memory safety property and the potential undefined behavior.
