 1) Issue Found:
The code has a vulnerability known as a null pointer dereference. In the function `first_char_is_a()`, when `p` is null, accessing `s[0]` results in a dereference of a null pointer, which can lead to undefined behavior.

2) Fixed Code:
```c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int first_char_is_a(const char *s) {
    if (s != NULL && s[0] == 'a') {
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

int main(void) {
    char *p = malloc(1); // Allocate memory for p
    assert(p != NULL);
    int r = first_char_is_a(p);
    free(p); // Free the allocated memory after usage
    assert(r == 0);
    return 0;
}
```

3) Why This Fix Works:
The fix prevents the null pointer dereference by adding a check for `NULL` before accessing `s[0]`. Additionally, the code now dynamically allocates memory for `p` using `malloc()`, ensuring that it is not `NULL` during execution. The memory is also properly freed after usage to avoid leaks. This fix eliminates the possibility of undefined behavior caused by a null pointer dereference.
