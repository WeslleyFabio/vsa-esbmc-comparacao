 1) Issue Found:
The vulnerability found is a violation of array bounds. In the code, the loop condition `i <= n` allows `i` to exceed the size of the array `v`. This results in dereferencing an out-of-bounds memory location, leading to undefined behavior and a violation of the safety property.

2) Fixed Code:
```c
int count_positive(const int *a, int n) {
    int c = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (a[i] > 0) {
            ++c;
        }
    }
    return c;
}
```
In the corrected code, the loop condition `i < n` ensures that `i` never exceeds the size of the array `a`. This prevents dereferencing an out-of-bounds memory location.

3) Why This Fix Works:
The root cause of the issue was using `i <= n` instead of `i < n` in the loop condition. By correcting this, the loop now stops iterating when it reaches the end of the array, thus preventing dereferencing out-of-bounds memory locations and resolving the violation of the safety property.
