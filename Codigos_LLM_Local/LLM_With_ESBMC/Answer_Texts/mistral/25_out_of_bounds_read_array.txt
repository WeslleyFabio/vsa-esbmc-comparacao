 1) Issue Found:
The code has a vulnerability where it attempts to read an element (a[i]) beyond the boundaries of the array during the for loop iteration `i <= n`. This results in a dereference failure and a violation of the array bounds, as reported by ESBMC.

2) Fixed Code:
```c
#include <assert.h>

int sum_array(const int *a, int n) {
    int s = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        s += a[i];
    }
    return s;
}

int main(void) {
    int v[3] = {1, 2, 3};
    int s = sum_array(v, 3);
    assert(s == 6);
    return 0;
}
```

3) Why This Fix Works:
The fix works by modifying the for loop condition to `i < n` instead of `i <= n`, preventing the iteration from going beyond the array bounds and avoiding the violation of the array bounds, which was causing the issue found by ESBMC.
