 1) Issue Found:
The program contains a memory leak, which occurs when the memory allocated with `malloc()` is not properly freed before the program terminates. This issue was found by ESBMC during the verification process because it triggered a violation of the assertion `data != NULL` in the main function.

2) Fixed Code:
```c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int *allocate_and_fill(int n, int value) {
    int *p = (int *)malloc((size_t)n * sizeof(int));
    if (!p) {
        return NULL;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        p[i] = value;
    }
    return p;
}

void free_data(int *data, int size) {
    if (data) {
        free(data);
    }
}

int main(void) {
    int *data = allocate_and_fill(4, 7);
    assert(data != NULL);
    int ok = data[0] == 7;
    assert(ok);
    free_data(data, 4);
    return 0;
}
```

3) Why This Fix Works:
The fix works by adding a new function `free_data()` that properly frees the memory allocated with `malloc()` when it is no longer needed. By calling this function in the main function before returning, we ensure that the allocated memory is properly deallocated and prevent memory leaks from occurring.
