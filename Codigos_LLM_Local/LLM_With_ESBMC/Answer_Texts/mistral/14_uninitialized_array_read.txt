 1) Issue Found:
The code has a vulnerability called "Use of Uninitialized Variable". The variable `a` is not initialized before being used in the function `sum_first_three`. This leads to undefined behavior, and the values assigned to the array elements are not predictable, causing the assertion failure. The violated property is `v == 0` which should hold true for correctly implemented code but fails due to the uninitialized variable.

2) Fixed Code:
```c
#include <assert.h>

int sum_first_three(void) {
    int a[3] = {0, 0, 0}; // Initialize the array with zeros.
    int s = a[0] + a[1] + a[2];
    return s;
}

int main(void) {
    int v = sum_first_three();
    assert(v == 0);
    return 0;
}
```

3) Why This Fix Works:
By initializing the array `a` with zeros, we ensure that its elements have predictable values. The unpredictable behavior caused by uninitialized variables is eliminated, and the assertion holds true, making the program safe.
