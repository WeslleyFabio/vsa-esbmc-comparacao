 1) Issue Found:
The code contains a logic error in the max_of_two function. It incorrectly returns `a` when `b` should be returned, if `a` and `b` have the same value. This leads to a violation of the assertion at line 12 in the main function that checks if `m` equals 5, which is not always true.

2) Fixed Code:
```c
int max_of_two(int a, int b) {
    return (a > b) ? a : b; // Using ternary operator to avoid the if-else condition
}
```
3) Why This Fix Works:
The issue was caused by incorrectly returning `a` when `b` should have been returned in case of equality. Using a ternary operator instead of an if-else statement ensures that the correct value is always returned, whether `a` and `b` are equal or not. The fix prevents the logic error from occurring and guarantees the correct assertion holds true.
