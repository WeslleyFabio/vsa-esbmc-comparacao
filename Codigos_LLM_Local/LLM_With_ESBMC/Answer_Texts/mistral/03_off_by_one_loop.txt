 1) Issue Found:
The code contains a logic error, specifically an off-by-one error in the `last_element` function. The loop iterates from 0 to n+1, causing an array index out of bounds when accessing `arr[n]`. This leads to a violation of the property that states the dereference should not exceed the array bounds.

2) Fixed Code:
```c
int last_element(int *arr, int n) {
    int last = arr[n-1];
    return last;
}
```
3) Why This Fix Works:
The fix addresses the root cause of the issue by correctly calculating the index for the last element in the array. The loop should iterate from 0 to n-1 to access all elements without going out of bounds. By changing the index calculation, the corrected version ensures that `arr[n-1]` is always a valid index, pointing to the correct last element in the array.
