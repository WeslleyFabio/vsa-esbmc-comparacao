 1) Issue Found:
The vulnerability found is a logic error, specifically an array index out-of-bounds access. The offending line in the function `index_of_min()` checks if `i <= n`, but the loop should actually iterate up to and including `n - 1`. This causes an access violation when trying to access array element `a[n]`.

2) Fixed Code:
```c
int index_of_min(const int *a, int n) {
    int idx = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (a[i] < a[idx]) {
            idx = i;
        }
    }
    return idx;
}
```
3) Why This Fix Works:
The fix corrects the loop condition from `i <= n` to `i < n`, ensuring that the iteration stops before reaching the out-of-bounds array access. The corrected version of the function properly iterates through the entire array and finds the minimum index, preventing the violation found by ESBMC.
