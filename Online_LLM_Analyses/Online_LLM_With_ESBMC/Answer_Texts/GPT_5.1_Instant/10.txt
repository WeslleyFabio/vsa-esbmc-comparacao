Issue Found:

The multiplication INT_MAX * 2 causes signed integer overflow, producing an undefined (wrapped) result.

The failed property is the assertion c >= a, which becomes false due to the overflowed result.

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

bool multiply_safe(int a, int b, int *out) {
    // Check for overflow before performing the multiplication
    if (a != 0 && (b > INT_MAX / a || b < INT_MIN / a)) {
        return false; // overflow would occur
    }
    *out = a * b;
    return true;
}

int main(void) {
    int a = INT_MAX;
    int b = 2;
    int c;

    // Ensure multiplication is safe
    bool ok = multiply_safe(a, b, &c);
    assert(ok);       // prevents undefined overflow
    assert(c >= a);   // now only checked when multiplication is valid
    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

The root cause is undefined behavior from signed integer overflow, which makes the assertion unreliable because c does not hold the mathematically expected product.

The fix performs a pre-multiplication overflow check using INT_MAX / a and INT_MIN / a.

By preventing execution of an overflowing multiplication, ESBMC no longer produces a counterexample, and the assertion is evaluated only in a mathematically sound case.
