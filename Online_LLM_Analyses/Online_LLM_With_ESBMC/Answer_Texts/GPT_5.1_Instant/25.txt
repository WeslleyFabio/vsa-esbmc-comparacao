Issue Found:

Vulnerability: Out-of-bounds array read in sum_array.

Violated Property: dereference failure: array bounds violated — loop condition i <= n causes access to a[n], which is outside the valid range when the array size is n.

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>

int sum_array(const int *a, int n) {
    int s = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {  // fix: stop at i < n
        s += a[i];
    }
    return s;
}

int main(void) {
    int v[3] = {1, 2, 3};
    int s = sum_array(v, 3);
    assert(s == 6);
    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

The root cause was an off-by-one error: i <= n makes the loop read one element past the end of the array.

Changing the condition to i < n ensures the loop iterates only over valid indices 0 through n-1, eliminating the out-of-bounds access and satisfying ESBMC’s array bounds property.
