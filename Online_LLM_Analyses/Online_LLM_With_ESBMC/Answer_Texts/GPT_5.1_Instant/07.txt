Issue Found:

Use-after-free vulnerability: The program dereferences pointer p after it has been freed.

Violated property: dereference failure: invalidated dynamic object — ESBMC correctly reports that p[0] is accessed after the associated dynamic memory has been released.

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    int *p = (int *)malloc(2 * sizeof(int));
    if (!p) {
        return 1;
    }
    p[0] = 10;
    p[1] = 20;
    free(p);
    p = NULL;        // prevent use-after-free

    // allocate again before use
    p = (int *)malloc(2 * sizeof(int));
    if (!p) {
        return 1;
    }
    p[0] = 30;
    assert(p[0] == 30);
    free(p);
    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

The root cause is that the program accesses memory (p[0]) after the block referenced by p has been freed, leaving p as a dangling pointer.

Setting p to NULL prevents accidental reuse, and reallocating memory ensures p[0] refers to a valid allocated object.

With this fix, ESBMC no longer encounters a dereference of an invalidated dynamic object, eliminating the reported violation.
