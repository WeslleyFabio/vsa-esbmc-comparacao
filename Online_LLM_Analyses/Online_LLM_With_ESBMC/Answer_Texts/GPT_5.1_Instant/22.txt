Issue Found:

The program returns a pointer to a stack-allocated variable (x) that goes out of scope once store_address() returns.

ESBMC reports a dereference failure: accessing an expired variable pointer (x).

Violated property: dereference of invalid (dangling) pointer.

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int *store_address(void) {
    int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
    *p = 5;
    return p;
}

int main(void) {
    int *q = store_address();
    int v = *q;
    assert(v == 5);
    free(q);
    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

The root cause was returning the address of a local stack variable, which becomes invalid after the function returns.

Allocating memory on the heap ensures that the pointed-to object remains valid in main().

ESBMC will no longer detect a dereference of an expired pointer because q now refers to a live heap object until explicitly freed.
