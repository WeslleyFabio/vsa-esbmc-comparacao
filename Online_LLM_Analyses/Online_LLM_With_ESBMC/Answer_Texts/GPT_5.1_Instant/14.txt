Issue Found:

Uninitialized memory read: The array a is declared but never initialized. ESBMC assigns arbitrary values, causing nondeterministic behavior.

Violated property: The assertion assert(v == 0) fails because v is computed from uninitialized data.

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>

int sum_first_three(void) {
    int a[3] = {0, 0, 0};  // Initialize the array
    int s = a[0] + a[1] + a[2];
    return s;
}

int main(void) {
    int v = sum_first_three();
    assert(v == 0);
    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

The root cause is that ESBMC models uninitialized variables as nondeterministic, allowing any value. Reading a[0], a[1], and a[2] therefore produces arbitrary integers.

Initializing the array removes nondeterminism, ensuring the sum is always zero, which satisfies the assertion.
