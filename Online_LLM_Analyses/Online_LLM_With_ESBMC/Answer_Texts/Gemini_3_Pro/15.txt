### 1\) Issue Found:

  * **Logic Error / Assertion Failure:** The function `max_of_two` contains a logic error. It currently implements a **minimum** function rather than a maximum function.
  * **Violated Property:** The assertion `assert(m == 5)` fails because the function returns `3` (the smaller value) instead of `5`.

### 2\) Fixed Code:

```c
#include <assert.h>

int max_of_two(int a, int b) {
    // Corrected condition: checks if 'a' is greater than 'b'
    if (a > b) {
        return a;
    }
    return b;
}

int main(void) {
    int m = max_of_two(3, 5);
    assert(m == 5);
    return 0;
}
```

### 3\) Why This Fix Works:

  * **Root Cause:** The original code used the condition `if (a < b)` and returned `a`. This means it returned `a` when `a` was smaller than `b`, effectively finding the minimum value.
  * **Fix Explanation:** Changing the condition to `if (a > b)` ensures that `a` is returned only when it is numerically larger than `b`. Consequently, when `max_of_two(3, 5)` is called, the condition `3 > 5` evaluates to false, causing the function to return `b` (5). This satisfies the assertion `m == 5`.
