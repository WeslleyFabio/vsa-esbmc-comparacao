You are an expert in formal verification.

Analyze the code and its verification report, and provide a concise explanation following exactly this structure:

1) Issue Found:
- Identify the vulnerability or formal verification failure.
- Mention the violated property if applicable.

2) Fixed Code:
- Provide a corrected version of the full C code.
- Use a \\\`c fenced code block.
- Keep the original logic whenever possible.

3) Why This Fix Works:
- Brief technical explanation describing the root cause.

--------------------------
C Source Code:
\\\`c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int value;
};

int main(void) {
    struct Node *a = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    struct Node *b = a;
    if (!a) {
        return 1;
    }
    a->value = 42;
    assert(b->value == 42);
    free(a);
    free(b);
    return 0;
}
