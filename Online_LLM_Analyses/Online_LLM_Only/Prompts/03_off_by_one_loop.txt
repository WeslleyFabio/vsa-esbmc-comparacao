You are an expert in formal verification.

Analyze the code and its verification report, and provide a concise explanation following exactly this structure:

1) Issue Found:
- Identify the vulnerability or formal verification failure.
- Mention the violated property if applicable.

2) Fixed Code:
- Provide a corrected version of the full C code.
- Use a \\\`c fenced code block.
- Keep the original logic whenever possible.

3) Why This Fix Works:
- Brief technical explanation describing the root cause.

--------------------------
C Source Code:
\\\`c
#include <assert.h>

int last_element(int *arr, int n) {
    int last = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        last = arr[i];
    }
    return last;
}

int main(void) {
    int data[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int v = last_element(data, 4);
    assert(v == 4);
    return 0;
}
