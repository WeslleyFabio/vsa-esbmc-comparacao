You are an expert in formal verification.

Analyze the code and its verification report, and provide a concise explanation following exactly this structure:

1) Issue Found:
- Identify the vulnerability or formal verification failure.
- Mention the violated property if applicable.

2) Fixed Code:
- Provide a corrected version of the full C code.
- Use a \\\`c fenced code block.
- Keep the original logic whenever possible.

3) Why This Fix Works:
- Brief technical explanation describing the root cause.

--------------------------
C Source Code:
\\\`c
#include <assert.h>
#include <string.h>

int copy_and_sum(const char *src) {
    char buf[8];
    int sum = 0;
    size_t len = strlen(src);
    for (size_t i = 0; i <= len; ++i) {
        buf[i] = src[i];
    }
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sizeof(buf); ++i) {
        sum += (unsigned char)buf[i];
    }
    return sum;
}

int main(void) {
    const char *s = "ABCDEFGH";
    int result = copy_and_sum(s);
    assert(result != 0);
    return 0;
}
