You are an expert in formal verification.

Analyze the code and its verification report, and provide a concise explanation following exactly this structure:

1) Issue Found:
- Identify the vulnerability or formal verification failure.
- Mention the violated property if applicable.

2) Fixed Code:
- Provide a corrected version of the full C code.
- Use a \\\`c fenced code block.
- Keep the original logic whenever possible.

3) Why This Fix Works:
- Brief technical explanation describing the root cause.

--------------------------
C Source Code:
\\\`c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    int *p = (int *)malloc(2 * sizeof(int));
    if (!p) {
        return 1;
    }
    p[0] = 1;
    p[1] = 2;
    int *q = (int *)realloc(p, 4 * sizeof(int));
    if (q == NULL) {
        free(p);
        return 1;
    }
    free(p);
    q[2] = 3;
    q[3] = 4;
    assert(q[3] == 4);
    free(q);
    return 0;
}
