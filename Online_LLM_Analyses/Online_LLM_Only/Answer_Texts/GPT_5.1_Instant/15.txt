Issue Found:

The function max_of_two contains a logic bug: it returns the smaller value when a < b, instead of the larger one.

This causes the post-condition assert(m == 5) to fail because max_of_two(3, 5) incorrectly returns 3.

Violated property: Functional correctness — specifically, the expected behavior of a max function.

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>

int max_of_two(int a, int b) {
    if (a > b) {
        return a;
    }
    return b;
}

int main(void) {
    int m = max_of_two(3, 5);
    assert(m == 5);
    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

The root cause was an inverted comparison: the original implementation tested a < b but returned a, which is the smaller value.

By changing the condition to a > b and returning a only when it is indeed the maximum, the function now satisfies its intended contract. The assertion now holds for all valid inputs.
