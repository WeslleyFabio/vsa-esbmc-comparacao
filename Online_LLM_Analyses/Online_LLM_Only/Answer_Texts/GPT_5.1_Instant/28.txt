Issue Found:

Buffer overflow: memcpy(b->data, src, sizeof(*b)) copies sizeof(struct Buffer) bytes (8 bytes of data + 4 bytes of int = typically 12 bytes), which overwrites b->flag.

Violated property: Memory safety / preservation of b.flag (assertion b.flag == 1 fails).

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>
#include <string.h>

struct Buffer {
    char data[8];
    int flag;
};

void fill_buffer(struct Buffer *b, const char *src) {
    /* Copy only into data field */
    memcpy(b->data, src, sizeof(b->data));
}

int main(void) {
    struct Buffer b;
    b.flag = 1;
    fill_buffer(&b, "ABCDEFGH");
    assert(b.flag == 1);
    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

The root cause was copying too many bytes, causing memcpy to overwrite beyond data and corrupt flag.

Restricting the copy to sizeof(b->data) ensures the write stays within bounds, preserving b.flag and satisfying the assertion.
