Issue Found:

The code performs a use-after-free: memory is written and read through p after it has been freed.

Violated property: memory safety / invalid dereference (access to deallocated heap object).

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    int *p = (int *)malloc(2 * sizeof(int));
    if (!p) {
        return 1;
    }
    p[0] = 10;
    p[1] = 20;

    /* Use the memory before freeing it */
    p[0] = 30;
    assert(p[0] == 30);

    /* Now it is safe to free and stop using the pointer */
    free(p);
    p = NULL;  /* defensive nullification */

    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

The root cause was accessing memory after free, which leaves p dangling.

Moving all accesses before freeing the buffer, and nullifying the pointer afterward, ensures no dereference occurs on deallocated memory, restoring memory-safety.
