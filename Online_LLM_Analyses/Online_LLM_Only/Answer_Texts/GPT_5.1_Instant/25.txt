Issue Found:

Out-of-bounds array access in sum_array: the loop runs from i = 0 to i <= n, which accesses a[n]—one past the last valid index (n-1).

Violated property: memory safety / array bounds.

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>

int sum_array(const int *a, int n) {
    int s = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {   // fixed bound
        s += a[i];
    }
    return s;
}

int main(void) {
    int v[3] = {1, 2, 3};
    int s = sum_array(v, 3);
    assert(s == 6);
    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

The root cause was an incorrect loop condition (i <= n) that iterated one step too far.

Changing it to i < n ensures accesses remain within the valid range 0 … n-1, eliminating the out-of-bounds violation.
