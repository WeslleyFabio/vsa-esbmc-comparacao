Issue Found:

Out-of-bounds heap write: p = base + 3 points one past the allocated 3-element array. Writing p[0] = 10 performs a write outside allocated memory.

Violated property: Memory safety (no out-of-bounds access).

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    int *base = (int *)malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
    if (!base) {
        return 1;
    }
    int *p = base + 2;  // point to last valid element
    p[0] = 10;          // now writing within bounds
    assert(p[0] == 10);
    free(base);
    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:
The bug occurred because the code wrote to the element at index 3 of a 3-element allocation, which is invalid. Adjusting the pointer so that p references the last valid element ensures p[0] stays within the allocated memory region.
