Issue Found:

Vulnerability: Double free: both a and b point to the same allocated object, so calling free(a) followed by free(b) frees the same memory twice.

Violated Property: Memory safety / no-double-free (typical formal verification safety property).

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int value;
};

int main(void) {
    struct Node *a = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    if (!a) {
        return 1;
    }

    struct Node *b = a;  // alias, do not free twice

    a->value = 42;
    assert(b->value == 42);

    free(a);
    /* b should not be freed because it aliases a */

    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

a and b refer to the same allocation; freeing one invalidates both pointers.

Removing the second free(b) eliminates the double-free, ensuring memory is released exactly once and satisfying memory-safety properties.
