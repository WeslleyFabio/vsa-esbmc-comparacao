1) Issue Found:

Vulnerability: Out-of-bounds read.
The loop runs with i <= n, but valid indices for an array of length n are 0 … n-1.

Violated property: Memory safety / array-bounds property.

2) Fixed Code:
#include <assert.h>

int index_of_min(const int *a, int n) {
    int idx = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {   // stop at n-1
        if (a[i] < a[idx]) {
            idx = i;
        }
    }
    return idx;
}

int main(void) {
    int v[3] = {5, 2, 9};
    int idx = index_of_min(v, 3);
    assert(idx == 1);
    return 0;
}

3) Why This Fix Works:

The root cause was that the loop allowed i == n, causing an access to a[n], which is outside the valid array range.

Changing the condition to i < n ensures all accesses remain within bounds, preserving the intended logic of scanning all elements safely.
