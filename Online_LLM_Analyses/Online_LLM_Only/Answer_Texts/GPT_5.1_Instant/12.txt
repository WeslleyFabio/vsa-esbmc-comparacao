Issue Found:

Vulnerability: Division by zero in safe_divide(x, y) when y = 0.

Violated Property: Arithmetic safety — verifier reports possible division-by-zero and the assertion is unreachable/meaningless due to undefined behavior.

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>

int safe_divide(int a, int b) {
    /* Prevent division by zero */
    if (b == 0) {
        return 0;   /* Defined safe fallback */
    }
    return a / b;
}

int main(void) {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 0;
    int z = safe_divide(x, y);
    assert(z == 0);   /* Now guaranteed */
    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

The root cause is that division by zero is undefined behavior.

By checking b == 0 before performing the division, the function guarantees a well-defined return value, restoring the verifier’s ability to reason about the assertion.
