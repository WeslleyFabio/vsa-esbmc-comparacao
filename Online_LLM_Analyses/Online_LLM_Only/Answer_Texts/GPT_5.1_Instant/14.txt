Issue Found:

Use of uninitialized variables: The array a[3] is never initialized, so reading a[0], a[1], and a[2] produces undefined behavior.

Violated property: Determinism / memory-safety property — the verifier cannot prove v == 0 because s is computed from uninitialized memory.

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>

int sum_first_three(void) {
    int a[3] = {0, 0, 0};   // Initialize all elements
    int s = a[0] + a[1] + a[2];
    return s;
}

int main(void) {
    int v = sum_first_three();
    assert(v == 0);
    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

The failure occurred because reading uninitialized stack memory results in nondeterministic values, preventing the assertion from being guaranteed.

Initializing the array removes the undefined behavior, making the computed sum deterministically zero, which satisfies the assertion.
