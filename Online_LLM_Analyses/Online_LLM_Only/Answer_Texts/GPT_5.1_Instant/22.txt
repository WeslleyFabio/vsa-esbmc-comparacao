Issue Found:

Vulnerability: The function store_address() returns the address of a local variable (x). After the function returns, x goes out of scope, so p becomes a dangling pointer.

Violated property: Memory safety / use-after-free (dangling pointer dereference).

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int *store_address(void) {
    int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
    assert(p != NULL);
    *p = 5;
    return p;
}

int main(void) {
    int *q = store_address();
    int v = *q;
    assert(v == 5);
    free(q);
    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:
The original bug occurred because the program returned a pointer to a stack variable whose lifetime ended when the function returned. By allocating the integer on the heap, the pointer remains valid until explicitly freed, eliminating the dangling-pointer dereference.
