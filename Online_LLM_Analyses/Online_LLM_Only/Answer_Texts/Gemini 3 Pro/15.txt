### 1\) Issue Found

  * **Vulnerability/Failure:** Logical error leading to an Assertion Failure.
  * **Violated Property:** `assert(m == 5)` fails.
  * **Description:** The function `max_of_two` incorrectly implements "minimum" logic instead of "maximum." When `a < b` is true, it returns `a` (the smaller value), causing `max_of_two(3, 5)` to return `3` instead of the expected `5`.

### 2\) Fixed Code

```c
#include <assert.h>

int max_of_two(int a, int b) {
    // Corrected condition to return the larger value
    if (a > b) {
        return a;
    }
    return b;
}

int main(void) {
    int m = max_of_two(3, 5);
    assert(m == 5);
    return 0;
}
```

### 3\) Why This Fix Works

The root cause was the conditional check `if (a < b)` returning `a`, which selects the minimum value. By changing the condition to `if (a > b)` (or keeping the condition and swapping the return values), the function correctly identifies and returns the larger integer. This ensures `m` equals `5` in `main`, satisfying the formal assertion.
