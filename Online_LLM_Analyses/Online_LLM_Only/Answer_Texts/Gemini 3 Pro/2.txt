Here is the analysis of the formal verification failure and the corrected code.

### 1\) Issue Found

**Heap Buffer Overflow (Out-of-bounds Write)**
The function `duplicate_prefix` allocates a buffer of size `n` (`malloc(n)`) but attempts to write `n + 1` bytes into it (`memcpy(..., n + 1)`). This causes a write outside the allocated memory bounds. Additionally, the resulting string is not guaranteed to be null-terminated correctly, which leads to undefined behavior when used as a C-string.

### 2\) Fixed Code

```c
#include <assert.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

char *duplicate_prefix(const char *src, size_t n) {
    // Allocate n bytes for content + 1 byte for the null terminator
    char *buf = (char *)malloc(n + 1);
    if (!buf) {
        return NULL;
    }
    
    // Copy exactly n bytes from source
    memcpy(buf, src, n);
    
    // Explicitly add the null terminator at the end
    buf[n] = '\0';
    
    return buf;
}

int main(void) {
    const char *s = "hello world";
    char *p = duplicate_prefix(s, 5);
    assert(p != NULL);
    // p now contains "hello\0"
    free(p);
    return 0;
}
```

### 3\) Why This Fix Works

This fix resolves the buffer overflow by allocating `n + 1` bytes, ensuring there is sufficient space for both the requested prefix characters and the null terminator. It changes the copy operation to copy exactly `n` bytes (preventing it from reading potentially unwanted characters or overflowing the destination) and manually sets the final byte to `\0` to ensure a valid, null-terminated C-string.

Would you like me to explain how to verify this fix using a tool like CBMC or Frama-C?
