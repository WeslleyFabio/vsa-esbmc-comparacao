### 1\) Issue Found:

**Memory Leak**
The program allocates memory on the heap using `malloc` inside the `allocate_and_fill` function but fails to release it using `free` before the `main` function terminates. Formal verification tools (such as CBMC or Frama-C) flag this as a resource leak violation because the pointer `data` goes out of scope while still holding a reference to allocated memory.

### 2\) Fixed Code:

```c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int *allocate_and_fill(int n, int value) {
    // Good practice: protect against non-positive n, though not strictly the leak cause
    if (n <= 0) return NULL;

    int *p = (int *)malloc((size_t)n * sizeof(int));
    if (!p) {
        return NULL;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        p[i] = value;
    }
    return p;
}

int main(void) {
    int *data = allocate_and_fill(4, 7);
    
    // Ensure allocation succeeded before usage
    assert(data != NULL);
    
    int ok = data[0] == 7;
    assert(ok);
    
    // FIX: Release the allocated memory
    free(data);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### 3\) Why This Fix Works:

Formal verification tools track the lifecycle of heap-allocated objects. A correct verification trace requires that every successful `malloc` is matched with a corresponding `free` on all possible execution paths. By adding `free(data)` at the end of `main`, we explicitly deallocate the memory, satisfying the property that no memory is left leaked upon program exit.

Would you like me to explain how to detect this using a specific tool like CBMC or Valgrind?
