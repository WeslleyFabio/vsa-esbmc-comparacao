### 1\) Issue Found

**Division by Zero**: The function `safe_divide` performs the operation `a / b` without checking if `b` is zero. In `main`, the function is called with `y = 0`, causing a runtime error (Undefined Behavior) and a formal verification failure regarding arithmetic safety.

### 2\) Fixed Code

```c
#include <assert.h>

int safe_divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        return 0; // Handle division by zero safely
    }
    return a / b;
}

int main(void) {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 0;
    int z = safe_divide(x, y);
    assert(z == 0);
    return 0;
}
```

### 3\) Why This Fix Works

The fix introduces a conditional check `if (b == 0)` before the division operation. This ensures that the program never executes a division instruction with a zero denominator, thus preventing the undefined behavior. By returning `0` in the error case, the function satisfies the specific assertion `z == 0` in `main`, making the verification pass.

Would you like me to show you how to write a formal contract (like ACSL) for this function to verify it with tools like Frama-C?
