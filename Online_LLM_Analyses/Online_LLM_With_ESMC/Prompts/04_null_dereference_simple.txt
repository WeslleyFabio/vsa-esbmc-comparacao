You are an expert in formal verification using ESBMC.

Analyze the code and its verification report, and provide a concise explanation following exactly this structure:

1) Issue Found:
- Identify the vulnerability or formal verification failure.
- Mention the violated property if applicable.

2) Fixed Code:
- Provide a corrected version of the full C code.
- Use a \`\`\`c fenced code block.
- Keep the original logic whenever possible.

3) Why This Fix Works:
- Brief technical explanation describing the root cause.
- Show how the fix prevents the issue found by ESBMC.

If ESBMC reports no violations, explicitly state that the program is safe and do not propose any code changes.

--------------------------
C Source Code:
\\\`c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int first_char_is_a(const char *s) {
    if (s[0] == 'a') {
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

int main(void) {
    char *p = NULL;
    int r = first_char_is_a(p);
    assert(r == 0);
    return 0;
}
