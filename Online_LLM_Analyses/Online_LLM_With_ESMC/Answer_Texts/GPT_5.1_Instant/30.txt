Issue Found:

The program performs a double free: both a and b point to the same dynamically allocated object, so calling free(a) invalidates the memory, and calling free(b) triggers a “dereference failure: invalidated dynamic object freed”.

Violated property: Memory safety — double free / use of invalidated dynamic object.

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int value;
};

int main(void) {
    struct Node *a = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    struct Node *b = a;

    if (!a) {
        return 1;
    }

    a->value = 42;
    assert(b->value == 42);

    /* Free only once since a and b alias the same object */
    free(a);
    /* Prevent accidental use */
    a = NULL;
    b = NULL;

    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

The root cause is that a and b alias the same allocated block, so freeing both results in a double free.

The fix ensures the memory is freed exactly once, and the pointers are set to NULL, preventing ESBMC from detecting a second free on an invalidated dynamic object.

This removes the memory-safety violation and satisfies ESBMC’s dynamic object validity checks.
