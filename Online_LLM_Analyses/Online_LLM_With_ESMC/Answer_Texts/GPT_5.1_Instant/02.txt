Issue Found:

Vulnerability: Heap buffer overflow.

Violated Property: dereference failure: array bounds violated during the memcpy call.

Cause: The code allocates n bytes but copies n + 1 bytes (including the null terminator), writing past the allocated buffer.

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

char *duplicate_prefix(const char *src, size_t n) {
    /* allocate n + 1 bytes to store n chars plus '\0' */
    char *buf = (char *)malloc(n + 1);
    if (!buf) {
        return NULL;
    }
    memcpy(buf, src, n);
    buf[n] = '\0';  /* ensure null-termination */
    return buf;
}

int main(void) {
    const char *s = "hello world";
    char *p = duplicate_prefix(s, 5);
    assert(p != NULL);
    free(p);
    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

The root cause was copying one extra byte (the null terminator) into a buffer that was too small.

By allocating n + 1 bytes and copying only n bytes before appending a '\\0', the code ensures all writes stay within bounds.

ESBMC’s memory model now sees no out-of-bounds access, preventing the dereference failure previously detected.
