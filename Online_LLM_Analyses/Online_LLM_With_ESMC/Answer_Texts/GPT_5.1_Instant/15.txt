Issue Found:

Logic error in max_of_two: The function incorrectly returns a when a < b, producing the minimum, not the maximum.

Violated property: The assertion m == 5 fails because max_of_two(3, 5) returns 3.

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>

int max_of_two(int a, int b) {
    if (a < b) {
        return b;  // return the larger value
    }
    return a;
}

int main(void) {
    int m = max_of_two(3, 5);
    assert(m == 5);
    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

The root cause was an inverted comparison: the function returned the smaller argument when a < b was true.

By returning b in that branch, the function now correctly implements the maximum operation, ensuring the assertion m == 5 holds. ESBMC will no longer find a counterexample.
