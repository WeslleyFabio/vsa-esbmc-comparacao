Issue Found:

The program dereferences a pointer after it has been freed, causing a use-after-free vulnerability.

ESBMC reports a violation of the dereference safety property:
“dereference failure: invalidated dynamic object”.

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int sum_array(int *a, int n) {
    int s = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        s += a[i];
    }
    return s;
}

int main(void) {
    int *data = (int *)malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
    if (!data) {
        return 1;
    }

    data[0] = 1;
    data[1] = 2;
    data[2] = 3;

    /* Use the data before freeing it */
    int result = sum_array(data, 3);
    assert(result == 6);

    free(data);
    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

The root cause is that the original program calls sum_array(data, 3) after data has been freed, leaving the pointer pointing to an invalid memory region.

By moving the free(data) call after all accesses, the pointer remains valid during sum_array, preventing ESBMC’s reported dereference of an invalid dynamic object.
Thus, the use-after-free condition is eliminated.
