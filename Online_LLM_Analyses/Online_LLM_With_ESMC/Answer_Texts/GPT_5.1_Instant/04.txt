Issue Found:

Vulnerability: NULL-pointer dereference. The function first_char_is_a unconditionally accesses s[0] even when s is NULL.

Violated Property: dereference failure: NULL pointer (reported by ESBMC).

Fixed Code:

#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int first_char_is_a(const char *s) {
    if (s == NULL) {
        return 0; // safely handle NULL pointer
    }
    if (s[0] == 'a') {
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

int main(void) {
    char *p = NULL;
    int r = first_char_is_a(p);
    assert(r == 0);
    return 0;
}


Why This Fix Works:

The root cause is that first_char_is_a dereferences s without validating it, which causes a NULL-pointer dereference when main passes p = NULL.

The fix adds a NULL check before accessing s[0], ensuring that no memory is dereferenced when s is NULL.
ESBMC no longer finds a dereference violation because the unsafe memory access path is eliminated.
